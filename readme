Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to perform regression on tabular data, predicting a target variable (Target_Pressure_(bar)). It employs various models, hyperparameter optimization using Optuna, and ensemble learning with a stacked regressor for enhanced performance. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature transformation, and advanced model training.

The project is designed as part of a university assignment.


Data Preprocessing:
- Handles missing values using KNN imputation.
- Scales features using RobustScaler.
- Transforms target and feature variables to reduce skewness.
Model Training:
- Implements MLPRegressor, LightGBM, Random Forest, and a custom ResNetTabular model.
- Optimizes model hyperparameters using Optuna.
- Evaluates model performance using MAPE and R² metrics.
Stacked Ensemble:
- Combines individual model predictions for improved accuracy.
Predictions:
- Outputs predictions on test data and saves them in test_predictions.csv.

Project Pipeline
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Cleans and transforms raw data.
   - Reduces skewness in features and normalizes the target variable.
2. Model Tuning:
   - Optimizes hyperparameters for individual models using Optuna.
   - Selects the best parameters for each model.
3. Model Training:
   - Trains models on preprocessed data.
   - Combines individual models into a stacked ensemble.
4. Evaluation:
   - Computes MAPE and R² for each model and the ensemble.
5. Prediction:
   - Generates predictions for test data.
   - Converts predictions back to the original scale and saves them.
